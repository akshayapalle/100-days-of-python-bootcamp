#Scope and Number Guessing game
#Local Scope
#Global Scope
#NameSpace
#There is no such thing as "Block Scope" in python (if we create a variable within a function, then it is only available in only within that function, but if we create 
# a variable within an "if" block or a "while-loop" or a "for-loop", then that does not count as creating a seperate local scope.
#Global scope is incredibly useful, especillay when defining constants.
#Global constants are variables which you define you never planning or changing it ever again. Ex: value of pi = 3.14159
#In order to differentiate these constants, the naming convention in python is turning into "uppercase" and sepearte with unerscores. Ex: URL, TWITTER_HANDLE, PI etc...
