#Scope and Number Guessing game
#Local Scope
#Global Scope
#NameSpace
#There is no such thing as "Block Scope" in python (if we create a variable within a function, then it is only available in only within that function, but if we create 
# a variable within an "if" block or a "while-loop" or a "for-loop", then that does not count as creating a seperate local scope.
